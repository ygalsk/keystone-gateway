# Chi Bindings Middleware System Analysis

## Executive Summary

The Chi router bindings have significant architectural issues in the middleware system that prevent proper middleware execution. While basic route registration works correctly, the middleware integration is fundamentally broken due to design flaws in how Lua functions are stored, retrieved, and executed across different Lua states.

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Components
- **Basic Route Registration**: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE routes work correctly
- **Parameter Extraction**: Path parameters (`{id}`, `*` wildcards) work properly
- **Route Groups Structure**: Groups now register routes correctly (fixed 404 issues)
- **Route Conflicts**: Duplicate route handling works as expected
- **HTTP Method Support**: Standard HTTP methods work properly
- **Context Isolation**: Request parameter isolation works correctly

### ❌ Broken Components
- **Middleware Registration**: Middleware not applying headers/logic correctly
- **Route Group Middleware**: Group middleware applying globally instead of scoped
- **Cross-State Function Calls**: Lua functions not accessible across different states
- **Middleware Pattern Matching**: While patterns match, execution fails

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Lua State Pool Architecture Conflict

**Problem**: The middleware system stores Lua functions in one state but tries to execute them in different states from the pool.

**Current Flawed Flow**:
```
Registration (State A): L.SetGlobal(funcName, middlewareFunc)
Execution (State B): luaState.GetGlobal(funcName) -> Returns nil
```

**Impact**: Middleware functions are never found during execution, causing silent failures.

### 2. Function Name Generation Issues

**Problem**: Function names use `L.GetTop()` which varies between states, making function retrieval inconsistent.

```go
// Current problematic approach
funcName := fmt.Sprintf("middleware_%s_%s_%d", tenantName, pattern, L.GetTop())
```

**Impact**: Even with predictable naming, the fundamental cross-state issue remains.

### 3. Route Registry Middleware Integration

**Problem**: The `RegisterMiddleware` function stores middleware definitions but never applies them to the Chi router.

**Current Flow**:
```go
// Middleware stored but never applied
r.middleware[def.TenantName] = append(r.middleware[def.TenantName], def)
```

**Impact**: Chi router never sees the middleware, so it's never executed.

### 4. Handler Wrapping Timing Issues

**Problem**: Middleware is registered after routes in the Lua script execution order, but our current wrapping approach tries to apply middleware at route registration time.

**Script Order**:
```lua
chi_middleware("/protected/*", function...) -- Registers middleware
chi_route("GET", "/protected/data", function...) -- Route already registered before middleware
```

## Failed Fix Attempts and Why They Failed

### Attempt 1: Route-Level Handler Wrapping
- **Approach**: Wrap individual route handlers with matching middleware
- **Failure**: Middleware not available at route registration time
- **Code**: `applyMatchingMiddleware()` in `lua_routes.go`

### Attempt 2: Chi Route() Method Integration  
- **Approach**: Use Chi's `Route()` method to apply middleware to patterns
- **Failure**: Caused routing conflicts and timeouts
- **Code**: `submux.Route(def.Pattern, func(middlewareRouter chi.Router)...)`

### Attempt 3: Predictable Function Naming
- **Approach**: Use MD5 hashes for consistent function names across states
- **Failure**: Still can't access functions stored in different Lua states
- **Code**: `funcName := fmt.Sprintf("middleware_%s", hex.EncodeToString(h[:])[:8])`

## Required Architectural Changes

### 1. Eliminate Cross-State Function Storage

**Current Problem**: Storing functions in one state, accessing from another
**Solution**: Execute middleware within the same script execution context

**Redesign Approach**:
```go
// Instead of storing functions across states, execute inline
middleware := func(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        // Re-execute the entire script in a fresh state
        // Find and execute the middleware function directly
        // Don't rely on global storage
    })
}
```

### 2. Implement Post-Registration Middleware Application

**Current Problem**: Middleware registered after routes
**Solution**: Apply middleware after all script execution is complete

**Redesign Approach**:
```go
// New method in LuaRouteRegistry
func (r *LuaRouteRegistry) ApplyStoredMiddleware(tenantName string) error {
    // After script execution, apply all stored middleware to matching routes
    // Use Chi's middleware system properly
}
```

### 3. Proper Chi Router Integration

**Current Problem**: Middleware never integrated with Chi's routing
**Solution**: Use Chi's native middleware system correctly

**Redesign Approach**:
```go
// Use Chi's Mount with middleware-enabled submux
submux := chi.NewRouter()
for _, mw := range middlewares {
    submux.Use(createChiMiddleware(mw))
}
r.router.Mount(mountPath, submux)
```

### 4. Middleware Scoping System

**Current Problem**: Group middleware applies globally
**Solution**: Implement proper middleware inheritance and scoping

**Redesign Approach**:
```go
type MiddlewareScope struct {
    Pattern    string
    GroupPath  string  // For group-scoped middleware
    GlobalPath string  // For global middleware
}
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Medium-term)
1. Middleware chaining and inheritance
2. Performance optimizations
3. Enhanced security measures
4. Comprehensive test coverage

## Conclusion

The middleware system requires a fundamental architectural redesign. The current approach of storing Lua functions across different states is inherently flawed and cannot be fixed with minor patches. A complete rewrite of the middleware execution model is necessary to achieve reliable middleware functionality.

The core issue is not with the middleware logic itself, but with how Lua functions are managed across the state pool architecture. This requires moving from a "store and retrieve" model to a "re-execute and apply" model for middleware functions.

**Recommendation**: Implement a simplified middleware system that re-executes the entire script context for middleware execution, eliminating cross-state dependencies entirely.
