7. **🌐 RESTful API**: Modern API-first design
8. **📊 Observable**: Comprehensive monitoring and metrics
9. **🚀 Self-Demonstrating**: Platform showcases its own capabilities
10. **🔒 Production-Ready**: Enterprise security and reliability

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### **Technical Assessment**
```
Performance:    159 req/sec (baseline competitive)
Architecture:   Single file, 314 lines
Complexity:     Monolithic functions (70+ line handlers)
Features:       Host/Path routing, health checks, multi-tenant
Dependencies:   Minimal (yaml.v3 only)
Deployment:     Single binary, YAML config
```

### **Strategic Gaps Identified**
- ❌ **Performance Ceiling**: Manual routing limits scalability
- ❌ **Code Maintainability**: Mixed concerns in large functions
- ❌ **API Compliance**: No RESTful admin/management APIs
- ❌ **CI/CD Integration**: Static configuration, no deployment awareness
- ❌ **Platform Showcase**: No demonstration of multi-service capabilities
- ❌ **Modern Patterns**: Missing middleware, observability, automation

## 🗺️ Three-Phase Evolution Strategy

## **Phase 1: Foundation Modernization (v1.2.1) - 2 Weeks**

### **Objective**: Establish modern architectural foundation
```
Chi Router Integration + RESTful API Foundation
Performance: 159 → 300+ req/sec (+89% improvement)

- [ ] **Metrics API**: Performance and operational metrics
- [ ] **Configuration API**: Dynamic configuration management

#### **Deliverables**
```go
// Modern Chi-based architecture (still single file)
func main() {
    r := chi.NewRouter()
    
    // Built-in middleware
    r.Use(middleware.RequestID)
    r.Use(middleware.Recoverer)
    r.Use(middleware.Logger)
    
    // Admin API
    r.Route("/admin", func(r chi.Router) {
        r.Get("/health", adminHealthHandler)
        r.Get("/metrics", adminMetricsHandler)
        r.Post("/reload", adminReloadHandler)
    })
    
    // Tenant routing with middleware
    setupTenantRouting(r, config)
}
```

#### **Success Metrics**
