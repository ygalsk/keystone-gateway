├── Keystone: 159 req/sec    ← Starting point
├── Basic Go proxies: 200-500 req/sec
└── Advanced Go proxies: 1000+ req/sec

Target State (v1.3.0):  
├── Keystone: 500+ req/sec   ← Target achievement
├── Similar complexity: 200-800 req/sec  ← Competitive  
└── Enterprise solutions: 10,000+ req/sec ← Different category
```

## 🛠️ **Implementation Strategy**

### **Development Principles**
1. **Backward Compatibility First**: Zero breaking changes
2. **Performance Before Features**: Optimize in v1.2.x, enhance in v1.3.0
3. **Simplicity Preserved**: Resist feature creep, maintain ease of use
4. **Incremental Delivery**: Small, testable improvements
5. **Risk Management**: Low-risk optimizations first

### **Architecture Evolution**
```
v1.2.0: Single file (~500 lines)     ← Current
v1.2.1: Single file (~600 lines)     ← Optimizations  
v1.2.2: Single file (~700 lines)     ← Caching
v1.2.3: Single file (~800 lines)     ← Pooling
v1.3.0: Consider modular (~1000 lines) ← Features

Decision Point: Keep single-file vs minimal modules at v1.3.0
```

### **Feature Development Order**
```
Priority 1 (Must Have):
├── Performance optimizations (v1.2.x)
├── Wildcard domains (v1.3.0)
└── Basic metrics (v1.3.0)

Priority 2 (Should Have):
├── Middleware system (v1.3.0)
├── Advanced health checks (v1.3.0)
└── Response compression (v1.2.2)

Priority 3 (Nice to Have):
├── Request logging (v1.3.0)
├── Rate limiting (v1.3.0)  
└── Hot configuration reload (future)
```
