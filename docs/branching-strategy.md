# Branching Strategy and Workflow

This document describes the comprehensive branching strategy and development workflow for Keystone Gateway. We use **GitLab Flow with Environment Branches** designed specifically for our multi-tenant API gateway architecture.

## üéØ Strategy Overview

Our branching strategy balances development agility with production stability, providing clear paths for feature development, testing, and deployment while maintaining the sophisticated infrastructure of Keystone Gateway.

### Key Principles

1. **Environment-Based Branches**: Each branch represents a deployment environment
2. **Linear History**: Prefer fast-forward merges where possible
3. **Conventional Commits**: Standardized commit messages for automation
4. **Automated Deployments**: CI/CD pipeline handles deployments
5. **Review Requirements**: All changes require code review

## üå≥ Branch Structure

### Long-lived Branches

#### `main` (Production)
- **Purpose**: Production-ready code deployed to live environment
- **Protection**: Protected branch with required reviews
- **Deployment**: Automatic deployment to production
- **Configuration**: `configs/environments/production-high-load.yaml`
- **Merge Policy**: Only from `staging` after successful testing

#### `staging` (Staging Environment)
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing and validation
- **Protection**: Protected branch with required reviews
- **Deployment**: Automatic deployment to staging environment
- **Configuration**: `configs/environments/staging.yaml`
- **Merge Policy**: From feature branches after code review

#### `develop` (Integration)
- **Purpose**: Integration branch for ongoing development (optional)
- **Usage**: For projects with continuous integration needs
- **Deployment**: Development/testing deployments only

### Short-lived Branches

#### `feature/*` (Feature Development)
- **Naming**: `feature/add-rate-limiting`, `feature/jwt-authentication`
- **Base**: Created from `staging` branch
- **Purpose**: New feature development
- **Lifespan**: Deleted after merge to staging
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests required

#### `bugfix/*` (Bug Fixes)
- **Naming**: `bugfix/fix-memory-leak`, `bugfix/health-check-timeout`
- **Base**: Created from `staging` branch
- **Purpose**: Non-critical bug fixes
- **Lifespan**: Deleted after merge to staging
- **Testing**: Regression tests required

#### `hotfix/*` (Critical Production Fixes)
- **Naming**: `hotfix/security-patch`, `hotfix/critical-crash`
- **Base**: Created from `main` branch
- **Purpose**: Critical production issues requiring immediate fix
- **Merge**: Direct to `main` with fast-track review
- **Cherry-pick**: Applied to `staging` to maintain consistency

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### 1. Feature Development

```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout staging
git pull origin staging
git checkout -b feature/add-lua-middleware

# Develop and commit (using conventional commits)
git add .
git commit -m "feat(lua): add middleware support for request validation"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/add-lua-middleware
# Create Pull Request to staging branch
```

### 2. Code Review Process

#### Review Requirements
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] Tests added/updated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Performance impact evaluated
- [ ] Configuration examples provided (if applicable)

#### Automated Checks
- [ ] CI pipeline passes
- [ ] Code quality checks pass
- [ ] Security scans pass
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements

### 3. Staging Deployment

```bash
# After PR approval and merge to staging
# Automatic deployment to staging environment
# Configuration: configs/environments/staging.yaml
# URL: https://staging.keystone-gateway.dev
```

#### Staging Testing Checklist
- [ ] Feature works as expected
- [ ] Integration with existing features
- [ ] Performance impact assessment
- [ ] Security validation
- [ ] Load balancing behavior
- [ ] Health check functionality
- [ ] Admin API responses

### 4. Production Release

```bash
# After successful staging testing
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge staging --no-ff
git push origin main

# Automatic production deployment
# Configuration: configs/environments/production-high-load.yaml
```

### 5. Hotfix Process

```bash
# Critical production issue
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-security-fix

# Make minimal, focused changes
git commit -m "fix(security): patch SQL injection vulnerability"

# Create PR to main (expedited review)
git push origin hotfix/critical-security-fix

# After merge to main, cherry-pick to staging
git checkout staging
git cherry-pick <hotfix-commit-hash>
git push origin staging
```

## üöÄ CI/CD Integration
