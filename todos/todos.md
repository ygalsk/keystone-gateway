# Define Repository Structure and Branching Strategy
Establish a clear repository organization and branching model. The goal is to design a workflow that supports smooth development, testing, and deployment. This includes analyzing the current repo state, deciding on branch naming conventions, and defining how features, bugfixes, and releases should be managed.

- Review current repo structure (branches, directories, files)
- Propose and document a branching strategy (e.g. main, dev, feature/*, hotfix/*, release/*)
- Define rules for merging and committing (e.g. PRs, rebase vs merge, squashing)
- Decide how todos and workflow automation should integrate with branching
- Consider project structure improvements (e.g. separating modules, adding CI/CD configs, documentation, etc.)
