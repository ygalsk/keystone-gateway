# Fix Test Config, Load Test, Deploy, and Create Cleanup Plan
**Status:** Done
**Agent PID:** 14131

## Original Todo
-the test config seems to be broken use load-test.sh for testing and check for any miss configs use deploy .sh to redpoly the changes and test if they are working with load-test.sh again, afetr the everything is working correctly set up a plan on how to clean up the repository and ship it

## Description
Set up and validate the complete production testing environment using Docker Compose to deploy real services, then run comprehensive load testing benchmarks using ./load-test.sh to measure performance. Fix any deployment configuration issues, validate that all services (gateway, nginx, backends, monitoring) work together properly under load, and create a cleanup plan to make the repository production-ready for shipping.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Set up SSL certificates or configure HTTP-only testing for local environment
- [x] Configure local DNS resolution for test domains (keystone-gateway.dev, api.keystone-gateway.dev)
- [x] Run deployment using ./deploy.sh and fix any configuration issues
- [x] Validate all services are running (gateway, nginx, backends, prometheus)
- [x] Fix nginx rate limiting configuration to allow proper production load testing
- [x] Fix unhealthy backends to ensure 100% accurate load testing results
- [x] Execute load testing benchmarks using ./load-test.sh
- [x] Analyze performance results and fix any load balancing/health check issues
- [x] Create comprehensive repository cleanup plan for production shipping
- [x] Automated test: Run ./deploy.sh successfully and verify all health checks pass
- [x] User test: Execute ./load-test.sh and confirm all benchmark tests complete with acceptable performance metrics
