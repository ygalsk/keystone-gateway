# Work through the repository structure plan
**Status:** ReadyForCommit
**Agent PID:** 346669

## Original Todo
work thorugh the repository strucutre plan

## Description
✅ **COMPLETED** - Repository structure plan implementation complete! All legacy tests fixed, proper package organization implemented, and repository cleaned of artifacts. The repository now fully matches the REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE_PLAN.md structure with all tests passing.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Move core types to internal packages - Extract Config, Gateway, TenantRouter types from main.go to appropriate internal/ packages
- [x] Fix unit test imports - Update test/unit/middleware_test.go to properly import types from internal packages  
- [x] Update build system - Modify Makefile to build from cmd/chi-stone/main.go instead of main.go
- [x] Create missing pkg/ structure - Add pkg/client/ directory for public API packages
- [x] Validate test execution - Ensure all tests pass with new package structure
- [x] Update documentation - Reflect new package imports in API documentation
- [x] Fix remaining test files - Update test/e2e/benchmark_test.go to use new package structure
- [x] Complete directory structure - Create missing subdirectories per REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE_PLAN.md
- [x] **Clean up artifacts** - Removed all backup files, logs, build artifacts, and Node.js dependencies
- [x] **Organize deployments** - Moved Docker Compose files to deployments/docker/
- [x] **Simplify mock backends** - Replaced Node.js mock backends with lightweight Go implementations

## Validation Results
- ✅ All tests pass (`make test-all`)
- ✅ Build system works (`make build`)
- ✅ Repository structure matches plan exactly
- ✅ No artifacts or legacy files remain
- ✅ Updated .gitignore to prevent future artifact issues

## Notes
Task completed successfully! The repository is now clean, well-organized, and fully follows the structure plan. All legacy test issues have been resolved and the codebase is ready for future development.
