# Repository Structure Plan Analysis

## Current State Assessment

### What Has Been Done (Phase 1 Partially Complete)
1. **Directory Structure**: The planned structure from REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE_PLAN.md has been largely implemented:
   - ✅ `cmd/chi-stone/` and `cmd/lua-stone/` exist
   - ✅ `internal/config/`, `internal/routing/`, `internal/health/`, `internal/proxy/` exist
   - ✅ `test/unit/`, `test/integration/`, `test/e2e/`, `test/fixtures/`, `test/mocks/` exist
   - ✅ `docs/` directory with comprehensive documentation
   - ✅ `configs/` with example configurations

### What Still Needs Work

#### 1. Legacy Test Issues
**Problem**: Tests in `test/unit/` use wrong package declarations and missing imports
- `test/unit/middleware_test.go` declares `package unit` but imports types like `NewGateway`, `Config` etc. without import statements
- These types are defined in the main package (`cmd/chi-stone/main.go` or similar)
- Tests cannot compile due to missing imports

#### 2. Package Structure Inconsistencies
**Problem**: Core types are still in main package instead of internal packages
- `Config`, `Gateway`, `TenantRouter`, etc. are in `main.go` 
- Should be moved to appropriate internal packages (`internal/config`, `internal/routing`)
- This prevents proper importing in unit tests

#### 3. Missing pkg/ Directory
**Problem**: No public API packages created yet
- Plan called for `pkg/client/` for Lua client SDK
- Currently missing this structure

#### 4. Build System Gaps
**Problem**: Makefile references don't align with new structure
- Makefile still builds single binary from main.go
- Should build from `cmd/chi-stone/main.go`
- Test commands need updating for new package structure

## Implementation Status by Phase

### Phase 1: Clean Repository (75% Complete)
- ✅ Directory structure created
- ✅ Files organized into new structure  
- ⚠️ Package imports and declarations need fixing
- ⚠️ Core types need moving to internal packages

### Phase 2: Enhance Testing (25% Complete)
- ✅ Test directory structure exists
- ❌ Unit tests broken due to import issues
- ❌ Package-specific tests need implementing
- ⚠️ Integration tests need updating for new structure

### Phase 3: Improve Documentation (90% Complete)
- ✅ Documentation structure excellent
- ✅ User guides comprehensive
- ⚠️ API documentation needs updating for new package structure

### Phase 4: Development Workflow (60% Complete)  
- ✅ Makefile exists with good workflow
- ⚠️ Build targets need updating for cmd/ structure
- ❌ GitHub Actions not yet implemented
- ❌ Code quality gates need updating

## Required Changes

### Immediate Fixes Needed
1. **Fix Unit Tests**: Update package declarations and imports in `test/unit/`
2. **Move Core Types**: Relocate types from main to internal packages
3. **Update Build System**: Fix Makefile to use cmd/ structure
4. **Package Imports**: Ensure all tests can import required types

### Critical Path
1. Move core types to internal packages (enables proper imports)
2. Fix test package declarations and imports
3. Update build system to match new structure
4. Validate all tests pass with new structure
