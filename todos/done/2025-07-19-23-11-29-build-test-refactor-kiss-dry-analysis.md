# Analysis: Build, Test, and Refactor for KISS/DRY Philosophy

## Build and Test Issues Analysis

### Build Status âœ… FIXED
- **Syntax error in chi_bindings.go**: Line 115 had extra closing brace - now resolved
- **Build now compiles**: Successfully builds chi-stone binary

### Test Failures ðŸ”´ CRITICAL
- **Lua integration tests failing**: Method syntax incompatibility (w:write() vs w.write)
- **Route registration issues**: Routes return 404 even when registered
- **Core tests passing**: Unit tests for config and routing work correctly

## KISS/DRY Violations Found

### Code Duplication (DRY Issues)
- **Duplicate host extraction**: extractHost() in main.go and gateway.go
- **Duplicate middleware**: HostMiddleware() and ProxyMiddleware() in both files
- **Duplicate HTTP method handling**: 3 identical switch statements in lua_routes.go
- **Duplicate Lua setup**: Similar patterns in engine.go and lua-stone/main.go

### Over-Engineering (KISS Issues)
- **Dual Lua systems**: Both embedded and external engines serving same purpose
- **Unnecessary abstractions**: LuaRouteRegistry.Engine interface with only 2 methods
- **Complex route matching**: 3 different routing strategies with nested logic
- **Mixed responsibilities**: main.go has middleware + proxy + app setup (382 lines)

## LOC Analysis (Target: <1000)
- **Current total**: 2,181 LOC (118% over target)
- **Largest files**: lua-stone/main.go (441), chi-stone/main.go (382), chi_bindings.go (334)
- **Major opportunity**: Remove dual architecture saves ~550 LOC

## Core vs Lua Separation Analysis
- **Good separation**: Basic proxy, health checks, static routing in core
- **Needs improvement**: Domain validation, path manipulation could move to Lua
- **Architecture alignment**: Single binary achieved, but complexity still in core

## Performance Concerns
- **Memory inefficiency**: New Lua state per request
- **Script parsing overhead**: Lua scripts parsed on every request vs pre-compilation
- **Goroutine leaks**: Timeout goroutines without proper cleanup
