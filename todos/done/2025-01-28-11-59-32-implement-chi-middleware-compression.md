# Implement Chi Middleware Compression
**Status:** Done
**Agent PID:** 33682

## Original Todo
check how to implement chis middleware compression

## Description
Based on comprehensive analysis of the keystone-gateway codebase, I need to implement HTTP response compression middleware using Chi's built-in compression functionality. The current application has a well-structured middleware stack in `cmd/main.go` but lacks response compression, which can significantly improve performance for text-based content like JSON API responses, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The implementation will leverage Chi's existing `middleware.Compress()` function that's already available as a dependency, providing gzip and deflate compression with configurable compression levels and content type filtering. This will be integrated into the existing `setupBaseMiddleware()` function following the established patterns.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] **Add compression middleware to setupBaseMiddleware()** in `cmd/main.go:130-142`
  - Import Chi's middleware package 
  - Add `middleware.Compress()` call after RequestID and before Timeout
  - Configure compression level 5 (balanced) with appropriate content types
  - Target content types: text/html, text/css, text/javascript, application/json, application/xml, text/plain

- [x] **Create unit tests for compression middleware** in `tests/unit/`
  - Create `compression_middleware_test.go` 
  - Test compression is applied for compressible content types
  - Test compression is skipped for non-compressible content (images, etc.)
  - Test compression headers are set correctly (Content-Encoding, Vary)
  - Test different compression levels and Accept-Encoding scenarios

- [x] **Add integration test for compression** in existing test files
  - Add compression test cases to `tests/unit/routing_test.go`
  - Verify compression works end-to-end through the gateway
  - Test that compressed responses are properly handled by proxy

- [x] **Add configuration option for compression** (optional enhancement)
  - Add compression settings to `internal/config/config.go`
  - Allow disabling compression or configuring compression level
  - Update example configurations to document the feature

- [x] **Update documentation and examples**
  - Add compression information to project documentation
  - Update any example configurations or README files
  - Document performance implications and recommended settings
