# Analysis: Fix Test Config, Load Test, Deploy, and Create Cleanup Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Critical Test Configuration Issues

1. **Go Version and Import Issues in real_load_test.go**:
   - HTTP Transport field error: `DialTimeout` doesn't exist, should use `DialContext`
   - Missing math/rand import: using crypto/rand but needs math/rand functions
   - These cause build failures preventing test validation

2. **Build Status**:
   - ✅ Main application builds successfully
   - ❌ Test suite fails to build due to compilation errors

### Health Check Implementation Status

✅ **Already Implemented and Working**:
- Active health check system in gateway.go with background goroutines
- StartHealthChecks() method and performHealthCheck() function
- Thread-safe backend status management
- Evidence from logs shows backends marked as HEALTHY

### Load Testing and Deployment Scripts

✅ **Scripts are Well-Designed**:
- **load-test.sh**: Comprehensive HTTPS testing (health, API, load balancing, sustained)
- **deploy.sh**: Production deployment pipeline with Docker Compose and health validation
- **Dependencies**: Requires Docker, SSL certificates, domain resolution

### Repository Cleanup Needs

**Critical Issues**:
- 27MB log file should be cleaned up
- Test build failures must be resolved
- Git working directory has uncommitted changes
- Development artifacts (todos/, coverage.html, index.html) need removal

**Security/Config Issues**:
- Hardcoded domains and development references
- Go version mismatch (1.19 in go.mod vs 1.22 in Dockerfile)
- Placeholder GitHub URLs in documentation

### Environment Dependencies

**Missing for Full Workflow**:
- Docker and Docker Compose installation
- SSL certificates for HTTPS testing
- Local DNS resolution for test domains
- Proper git cleanup

## Key Findings

1. **Health check bug appears RESOLVED** - implementation exists and logs show it working
2. **Test config issues are build/import problems** - not configuration mismatches
3. **Load testing workflow is designed correctly** - just needs environment setup
4. **Repository needs significant cleanup** before shipping readiness
