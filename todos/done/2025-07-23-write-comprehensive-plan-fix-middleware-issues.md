# Write comprehensive plan to fix middleware issues
**Status:** InProgress
**Agent PID:** 82479

## Original Todo
-lets write a comprhensive plan on how to fix these issues /home/dkremer/keystone-gateway/MIDDLEWARE_ANALYSIS.md

## Description
Create a comprehensive implementation plan to fix the fundamental architectural issues in the Keystone Gateway middleware system. The current system has critical flaws where middleware functions are stored in one Lua state but executed in different states, causing silent failures and security bypasses. This plan will redesign the middleware architecture to use script re-execution instead of cross-state function storage, implement proper Chi router integration, and fix route group middleware scoping issues.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Architecture Fixes (Immediate - 1-2 days)

#### 1.1 Redesign Middleware Execution Model
- [ ] Replace cross-state function storage with script re-execution approach in `chi_bindings.go:98-186`
- [ ] Implement `executeMiddlewareInContext()` function that parses and executes Lua functions within same script context
- [ ] Remove global function storage using `L.SetGlobal()` and `L.GetGlobal()`
- [ ] Add proper error handling with fail-secure defaults (return 500 instead of bypassing middleware)

#### 1.2 Implement Chi Router Integration
- [ ] Add missing `ApplyStoredMiddleware()` method to `lua_routes.go:105-114`
- [ ] Integrate stored middleware with Chi router using `router.Use()` and `router.Route()`
- [ ] Implement post-script-execution middleware application to handle timing issues
- [ ] Fix middleware pattern matching to work with Chi's routing patterns

#### 1.3 Fix Route Group Architecture
- [ ] Replace global state pattern tracking with proper group context stack in `chi_bindings.go:188-218`
- [ ] Implement true Chi route groups using `router.Route()` with scoped middleware
- [ ] Add `GroupContext` struct with middleware inheritance support
- [ ] Prevent middleware leakage between route groups

### Phase 2: Enhanced Error Handling & Testing (2-3 days)

#### 2.1 Comprehensive Error Handling
- [ ] Add middleware execution timeout controls
- [ ] Implement proper error isolation in middleware chain
- [ ] Add detailed logging for middleware execution failures
- [ ] Create fail-secure middleware execution with default deny behavior

#### 2.2 Fix Broken Tests
- [ ] Fix `TestChiMiddlewareRegistration` - ensure `X-Protected` header is set correctly
- [ ] Fix `TestChiRouteGroups` - verify group middleware scoping works properly
- [ ] Add test for middleware chaining with multiple middleware functions
- [ ] Add test for nested route groups with inherited middleware

#### 2.3 Add Missing Test Coverage
- [ ] Add edge case tests for middleware error handling
- [ ] Add performance tests for concurrent middleware registration
- [ ] Add security tests for middleware bypass prevention
- [ ] Add integration tests for Chi router middleware integration

### Phase 3: Performance & Advanced Features (3-4 days)

#### 3.1 Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement middleware function caching to avoid repeated script parsing
- [ ] Add script compilation caching for frequently used middleware
- [ ] Optimize Lua state pool usage for middleware execution
- [ ] Add middleware execution performance metrics

#### 3.2 Advanced Middleware Features
- [ ] Implement middleware chaining and inheritance for nested groups
- [ ] Add support for conditional middleware execution
- [ ] Implement middleware priority/ordering system
- [ ] Add middleware configuration validation

#### 3.3 Security Enhancements
- [ ] Add input validation for middleware patterns
- [ ] Implement middleware execution sandboxing
- [ ] Add security audit logging for middleware bypasses
- [ ] Create middleware security best practices documentation

### Automated & User Testing

#### Automated Tests
- [ ] Run `make test` after each phase to ensure no regressions
- [ ] Run `make lint` to ensure code quality standards
- [ ] Execute performance benchmarks for middleware execution
- [ ] Run security tests for middleware bypass prevention

#### User Tests
- [ ] Test middleware functionality with sample Lua scripts from `scripts/` directory
- [ ] Verify route group middleware inheritance works correctly in real scenarios
- [ ] Test concurrent middleware registration and execution
- [ ] Validate middleware error handling in production-like conditions

## Notes
This comprehensive plan addresses the fundamental architectural flaws identified in MIDDLEWARE_ANALYSIS.md. The core issue is cross-state function storage in the Lua state pool architecture. The solution involves redesigning the middleware system to use script re-execution instead of function storage, implementing proper Chi router integration, and fixing route group scoping. The plan is structured in three phases with increasing complexity, ensuring critical fixes are implemented first.
