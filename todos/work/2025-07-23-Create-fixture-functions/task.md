# Create fixture functions for common test setup patterns
**Status:** Refining
**Agent PID:** [pending]

## Original Todo
Create fixture functions for common test setup patterns

## Description
The core fixture functions for common test setup patterns (HTTP request creation, Lua engine initialization, config loading, integration env, etc.) are already implemented in `tests/testhelpers/fixtures.go`. These fixtures reduce duplication and improve maintainability. The next step is to ensure all fixtures are well-documented, general-purpose, and to add any missing helpers if needed.

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Review and update documentation/comments for all fixture functions in `tests/testhelpers/fixtures.go`
- [ ] Add or improve any missing general-purpose fixture helpers if needed
- [ ] Add or update tests to demonstrate fixture usage

## Notes
This is part of a larger test refactor to make tests KISS and DRY. The fixture functions should be general enough for use across multiple test files.
