## Current Test Coverage for Chi Functionality

### Working Tests (Passing):
1. **Basic Route Registration** - GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH/HEAD/OPTIONS routes work correctly
2. **Parameter Extraction** - Single parameters, multiple parameters, wildcard parameters all work
3. **Route Conflicts** - Duplicate route handling works as expected
4. **Context Isolation** - Request parameter isolation works correctly
5. **Subrouter Integration** - Mounting routes under different paths works
6. **HTTP Method Support** - Standard HTTP methods are properly supported
7. **Error Handling** - Invalid route registrations are handled gracefully

### Failing Tests (Issues Found):

#### 1. **Middleware Registration (BROKEN)**
- Test: `TestChiMiddlewareRegistration/protected_route_with_middleware`
- Issue: Middleware is not being applied correctly - the `X-Protected` header is not being set
- Expected: `X-Protected: true` header
- Actual: No header present

#### 2. **Route Groups (BROKEN)**
- Test: `TestChiRouteGroups` - All group routes return 404
- Issue: Route groups defined with `chi_group()` are not being registered properly
- Routes like `/api/v1/users` are not accessible and return 404 errors
- Group middleware (like `X-API-Version` header) is not being applied

#### 3. **Custom HTTP Methods (PARTIAL FAILURE)**
- Test: `TestChiHTTPMethods/CUSTOM_method`
- Issue: Custom HTTP methods are not supported by Chi router
- Expected behavior: Custom method support or graceful degradation
- Actual: Returns 405 Method Not Allowed

## Code Patterns and Structures Being Used

### Architecture Overview:
```go
Lua Scripts → chi_bindings.go → lua_routes.go → Chi Router
```

### Key Components:

1. **Lua State Pool** - Thread-safe Lua execution using a state pool pattern
2. **Route Registry** - `LuaRouteRegistry` manages dynamic route registration with thread safety
3. **Chi Bindings** - Lua functions: `chi_route()`, `chi_middleware()`, `chi_group()`, `chi_param()`
4. **Tenant-based Routing** - Routes are organized by tenant with submux mounting

### Current Lua API:
```lua
-- Route registration
chi_route("GET", "/path", function(w, r) ... end)

-- Middleware registration  
chi_middleware("/pattern/*", function(w, r, next) ... end)

-- Route groups
chi_group("/api/v1", function() ... end)

-- Parameter extraction
local id = chi_param(r, "id")
```

## Broken or Failing Tests Related to Chi Router

### Critical Issues:

1. **Middleware System (High Priority)**
   - Location: `internal/lua/chi_bindings.go:88-174`
   - Problem: Middleware registration and application logic is flawed
   - Impact: Security and functionality middleware not working

2. **Route Groups (High Priority)**
   - Location: `internal/lua/chi_bindings.go:176-201`
   - Problem: Route group implementation is incomplete/broken
   - Impact: API versioning and organized routing not working

3. **Route Registry Integration (Medium Priority)**
   - Location: `internal/routing/lua_routes.go:116-153`
   - Problem: Route groups not properly integrated with the registry

### Test Failure Summary:
- **3 out of 12 major test suites failing**
- **Middleware registration**: 100% failure rate
- **Route groups**: 100% failure rate  
- **Custom HTTP methods**: Partial failure (expected behavior)

### Dependencies:
- **Go Chi Router**: `github.com/go-chi/chi/v5 v5.2.2`
- **Lua Engine**: `github.com/yuin/gopher-lua v1.1.1`
- **Go Version**: 1.19

The Chi bindings implementation shows a solid foundation with comprehensive test coverage, but has critical functionality gaps in middleware and route group features that need to be addressed for production readiness.

Based on my comprehensive analysis of the Go project's test structure, here's what I found:

## Test Structure Analysis

### 1. Test Organization

The project follows a clear **3-tier testing structure**:

**Unit Tests** (`/home/dkremer/keystone-gateway/tests/unit/`):
- 17 unit test files covering individual components
- Focus on isolated functionality testing
- Fast execution, no external dependencies

**Integration Tests** (`/home/dkremer/keystone-gateway/tests/integration/`):
- 1 main integration test file (`routing_test.go`)
- Tests component interaction and routing behavior
- Uses temporary files and mock servers

**E2E Tests** (`/home/dkremer/keystone-gateway/tests/e2e/`):
- 1 comprehensive end-to-end test file (`gateway_test.go`)
- Tests full application lifecycle
- Currently has structural issues (binary build failing)

### 2. Testing Patterns Used

**Table-Driven Tests**: Extensively used across all test files
```go
testCases := []struct {
    name     string
    input    string  
    expected string
}{...}
```

**Test Helpers**: Centralized in `/home/dkremer/keystone-gateway/tests/testhelpers/helpers.go`
- `CreateTestGateway()` - Gateway factory
- `CreateMockBackend()` - HTTP mock server creation
- `AssertRouteMatch()` - Route matching assertions
- `RunRoutingScenarios()` - Batch route testing

**Fixture Data**: Test data organized in `/home/dkremer/keystone-gateway/testdata/`
- `configs/valid.yaml` and `configs/invalid.yaml`
- `scripts/test-routes.lua`

### 3. HTTP Routing and Chi Router Test Coverage

**Chi Router Integration** (`chi_bindings_test.go`):
- **Route Registration**: Tests basic GET/POST/PUT/DELETE route registration
- **Parameterized Routes**: Tests path parameters like `/users/{id}`
- **Middleware**: Tests custom middleware registration (currently failing)
- **Route Groups**: Tests grouped routes with shared middleware (currently failing)
- **HTTP Methods**: Tests all standard HTTP methods plus custom methods
- **Error Handling**: Tests invalid route patterns and nil handlers

**Routing Core** (`gateway_core_test.go`):
- **Host Extraction**: Comprehensive IPv4/IPv6/port handling
- **Path Matching**: Multi-tenant path prefix matching with priority
- **Backend Selection**: Round-robin load balancing with health checks
- **Proxy Creation**: Request forwarding and path stripping

**Integration Level** (`routing_test.go`):
- **Multi-tenant Routing**: Path-based and host-based tenant routing
- **Lua Script Integration**: Route registration through Lua scripts
- **Backend Health Checks**: Service health monitoring

### 4. Failing or Broken Tests

**Chi Bindings Issues**:
- `TestChiMiddlewareRegistration`: Middleware not applying headers correctly
- `TestChiRouteGroups`: Route groups returning 404 instead of expected responses
- `TestChiHTTPMethods`: Custom HTTP method 'CUSTOM' failing (expected behavior)
- `TestChiRouteRegistrationErrorHandling`: Error script execution failing routes

**E2E Test Issues**:
- `TestGatewayE2E`: Gateway binary build failing during test execution

**Skipped Tests**:
- `TestConcurrentRouteRegistration`: Skipped due to Chi router internal conflicts

### 5. Test Utilities and Helpers

**Core Helpers** (`/home/dkremer/keystone-gateway/tests/testhelpers/helpers.go`):
```go
- TestConfig: Standard multi-tenant configuration
- CreateTestGateway(cfg): Gateway instance factory  
- CreateMockBackend(t, body, status): HTTP test server
- AssertRouteMatch(t, gw, host, path, tenant, prefix): Route verification
- MinimalConfig(tenant, prefix): Simple configuration builder
- MultiTenantConfig(): Complex multi-tenant setup
- TestRoutingScenario: Structured test case definition
```

**Coverage Analysis**:
- Separate coverage files for different components:
  - `cmd_coverage.out`: Command-line interface coverage
  - `config_coverage.out`: Configuration loading coverage  
  - `lua_coverage.out`: Lua engine coverage
  - `routing_coverage.out`: Routing logic coverage

### 6. Key Test Files and Functions

**Unit Tests**:
- `/home/dkremer/keystone-gateway/tests/unit/chi_bindings_test.go`: Chi router Lua bindings
- `/home/dkremer/keystone-gateway/tests/unit/gateway_core_test.go`: Core routing logic
- `/home/dkremer/keystone-gateway/tests/unit/config_test.go`: Configuration validation
- `/home/dkremer/keystone-gateway/tests/unit/error_handling_test.go`: Error scenarios

**Integration Tests**:
- `/home/dkremer/keystone-gateway/tests/integration/routing_test.go`: `TestGatewayRouting`, `TestLuaRouteRegistry`, `TestBackendHealthCheck`

**E2E Tests**:
- `/home/dkremer/keystone-gateway/tests/e2e/gateway_test.go`: `TestGatewayE2E`, `TestHealthEndpoint`, `TestTenantRouting`

### Recommendations

1. **Fix Chi Middleware Integration**: The middleware tests are failing, indicating issues with Lua-to-Chi middleware binding
2. **Resolve Route Group Issues**: Route groups aren't being properly registered/mounted
3. **Fix E2E Binary Build**: The end-to-end tests can't build the gateway binary
4. **Improve Error Handling Coverage**: Many error scenarios are tested but could be more comprehensive
5. **Add Performance/Load Tests**: Current tests focus on correctness but lack performance validation

The test structure is well-organized with good separation of concerns, comprehensive helper utilities, and follows Go testing best practices. However, there are several failing tests that need attention, particularly around Chi router integration features.
