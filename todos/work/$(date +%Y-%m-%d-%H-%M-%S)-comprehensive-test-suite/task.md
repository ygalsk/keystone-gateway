# Comprehensive test suite with max coverage using fixtures
**Status:** AwaitingCommit
**Agent PID:** 213872

## Original Todo
- use the fixtures to write a comprehensive test suite with max coverage (table driven) and KISS and DRY complaint as well as following go best pratices and principals

## Description
Build a comprehensive test suite using the existing test fixtures to achieve maximum code coverage while following Go best practices. The suite will leverage the modern fixture-based architecture to create table-driven tests that are KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) compliant. This will replace scattered legacy tests with organized, maintainable test coverage across all core components.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Analyze existing test coverage using `go test -cover ./...` to establish baseline
- [x] Remove legacy test files that are causing import conflicts and preventing test execution
- [x] Identify core components needing comprehensive table-driven tests (internal/config, internal/lua, internal/routing)
- [x] Create comprehensive HTTP endpoint tests using `fixtures.HTTPTestCase` with all request methods and edge cases
- [x] Build Lua engine integration tests covering script loading, execution, and error handling scenarios
- [x] Implement routing tests covering multi-tenant scenarios, middleware chains, and proxy behavior
- [x] Add configuration validation tests covering all YAML parsing and validation edge cases
- [x] Create backend integration tests using specialized fixture backends (error, slow, echo, drop connection)
- [x] Build chi-bindings tests covering parameter extraction, route groups, and middleware registration
- [x] Implement comprehensive error handling tests for all failure modes
- [x] Automated test: Run `make test` and `go test -cover ./...` to verify coverage improvements
- [x] User test: Execute sample requests against all major endpoints to verify functionality
