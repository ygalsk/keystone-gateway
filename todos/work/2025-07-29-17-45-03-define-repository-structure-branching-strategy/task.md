## Original Todo
# Define Repository Structure and Branching Strategy
Establish a clear repository organization and branching model. The goal is to design a workflow that supports smooth development, testing, and deployment. This includes analyzing the current repo state, deciding on branch naming conventions, and defining how features, bugfixes, and releases should be managed.

- Review current repo structure (branches, directories, files)
- Propose and document a branching strategy (e.g. main, dev, feature/*, hotfix/*, release/*)
- Define rules for merging and committing (e.g. PRs, rebase vs merge, squashing)
- Decide how todos and workflow automation should integrate with branching
- Consider project structure improvements (e.g. separating modules, adding CI/CD configs, documentation, etc.)

## Description
Design and implement a comprehensive repository structure and branching strategy for the Keystone Gateway project. This includes establishing GitLab Flow with environment branches (main/staging/feature/*), implementing conventional commit standards, cleaning up development artifacts, creating environment-specific configurations, and setting up proper CI/CD integration. The goal is to create a production-ready workflow that balances stability with development agility while leveraging the existing sophisticated infrastructure.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Clean up development artifacts and fix configuration inconsistencies
- [ ] Create staging branch and environment-specific configurations
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipeline for environment-based deployments
- [ ] Implement conventional commit guidelines and branch protection rules
- [ ] Create comprehensive branching strategy documentation
- [ ] Set up deployment directory structure and enhanced CI/CD workflows
- [ ] Automated test: Verify CI/CD pipeline works with new branching strategy
- [ ] User test: Validate complete workflow from feature development to production deployment
