## Original Todo
extend the test suite logically and increase coverage start with crucial parts first

## Description
**Extend the test suite logically and increase coverage starting with crucial parts first**

This task involves improving test coverage for the Keystone Gateway project, focusing on critical components that are currently untested or poorly tested. The analysis revealed 0% effective coverage due to structural issues and identified a slow-running test (`TestLuaStatePoolExhaustion`) that blocks for 1+ seconds.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Fix slow `TestLuaStatePoolExhaustion` test (reduce timeout from 1s to 50ms)
- [x] Add missing unit tests for core routing logic (`internal/routing/gateway.go`)
- [x] Add concurrency safety tests for Lua state pool (`internal/lua/state_pool.go`)
- [x] Add HTTP request handling tests for security vulnerabilities
- [x] Add configuration validation tests for edge cases
- [x] Add integration tests for multi-tenant routing scenarios
- [x] Improve test organization and coverage reporting
- [x] Run full test suite and verify improvements
