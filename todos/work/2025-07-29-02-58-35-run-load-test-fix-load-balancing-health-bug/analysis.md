# Load Test and Health Check Analysis

Based on my research of the keystone-gateway codebase, I can now provide a comprehensive analysis of the load balancing and health check implementation. Here's what I found:

## Load Balancing and Health Check Implementation Analysis

### 1. Load Balancing Implementation

**Primary Location:** `/home/dkremer/keystone-gateway/internal/routing/gateway.go`

**Key Components:**
- **TenantRouter struct** (lines 29-34): Manages backends for each tenant with round-robin index
- **NextBackend() method** (lines 166-184): Core load balancing algorithm using round-robin with health checks
- **Round-robin algorithm** uses atomic operations for thread safety (`atomic.AddUint64(&tr.RRIndex, 1)`)

**Load Balancing Logic:**
```go
// Round-robin with health checks
for i := 0; i < len(tr.Backends); i++ {
    idx := int(atomic.AddUint64(&tr.RRIndex, 1) % uint64(len(tr.Backends)))
    backend := tr.Backends[idx]
    
    if backend.Alive.Load() {
        return backend
    }
}
// Fallback to first backend even if unhealthy
return tr.Backends[0]
```

### 2. Health Check Implementation

**Backend Health Status Tracking:**
- **GatewayBackend struct** (lines 20-27): Each backend has an `Alive atomic.Bool` field
- **Health status** is tracked atomically for thread safety
- **Health endpoints** are configured per service in YAML (e.g., `/health`, `/status`)

**Health Check Integration:**
- Health checks are **referenced** in configuration but **NOT actively implemented**
- The `health_interval` field exists in config but is not used by any background monitoring
- Backends start as "unhealthy" (`backend.Alive.Store(false)` on line 107)

### 3. Routing and Backend Selection

**Multi-tier Routing System:**
1. **MatchRoute()** (lines 139-164): Determines tenant router
   - Priority 1: Hybrid routing (host + path)
   - Priority 2: Host-only routing  
   - Priority 3: Path-only routing

2. **ProxyHandler()** in `/home/dkremer/keystone-gateway/cmd/main.go` (lines 107-122):
   - Uses MatchRoute to find tenant
   - Calls NextBackend() for load balancing
   - Creates proxy using CreateProxy()

**Backend Management:**
- **initializeRouters()** (lines 84-116): Sets up tenant routers from config
- **CreateProxy()** (lines 254-309): Creates cached reverse proxies per backend
- **Connection pooling** with optimized HTTP transport settings

### 4. Critical Bug Identified: Missing Health Check Monitoring

**The Major Issue:**
There is **NO active health check monitoring implementation**. The codebase has:
- Health check configuration (`health_interval`, `health` endpoints)
- Health status tracking (`Alive` atomic boolean)
- Health status reporting in admin API (`/admin/health`)

But it **lacks**:
- Background goroutines to perform periodic health checks
- HTTP requests to backend health endpoints
- Automatic marking of backends as alive/dead based on health responses

### 5. Health Status in Admin API

**Location:** `/home/dkremer/keystone-gateway/cmd/main.go` lines 66-94

The HealthHandler reports backend status but relies on manually set `Alive` flags:
```go
for _, backend := range router.Backends {
    if backend.Alive.Load() {
        healthyCount++
    }
}
status.Tenants[tenant.Name] = fmt.Sprintf("%d/%d healthy", healthyCount, len(router.Backends))
```

### 6. Test Coverage Analysis

**Comprehensive Test Files Found:**
- `/home/dkremer/keystone-gateway/tests/integration/backend_health_integration_test.go` - Health check integration tests
- `/home/dkremer/keystone-gateway/tests/unit/backend_integration_test.go` - Backend integration tests
- `/home/dkremer/keystone-gateway/tests/fixtures/backends.go` - Mock backend implementations

**Test Coverage Includes:**
- Backend alive status tracking
- Failover scenarios when backends go down
- Recovery simulation when backends come back online
- Load balancing with multiple backends

### 7. Configuration Examples

**Health Check Intervals Defined:**
- Development: 60-120 seconds
- Production: 15-30 seconds  
- Multi-tenant: 30-60 seconds

**Example Configuration:**
```yaml
tenants:
  - name: "api-tenant"
    health_interval: 30
    services:
      - name: "api-backend-1"
        url: "http://api-backend:3001"
        health: "/health"
```

### 8. Performance Optimizations Present

**Connection Pooling:** (lines 63-77 in gateway.go)
- MaxIdleConns: 100
- MaxIdleConnsPerHost: 50
- IdleConnTimeout: 120 seconds
- HTTP/2 enabled
- Proxy caching to avoid recreation

### Summary

The keystone-gateway has a solid foundation for load balancing and health checks but is **missing the critical active health monitoring component**. The load balancing works correctly using round-robin with health status checks, but the health status is never automatically updated from actual backend health endpoint responses. This explains the "load balancing health bug" mentioned in the todo items - backends remain marked as unhealthy even when they're actually available, leading to suboptimal routing decisions.

**Key Files for Implementation:**
- `/home/dkremer/keystone-gateway/internal/routing/gateway.go` - Core routing and load balancing
- `/home/dkremer/keystone-gateway/internal/config/config.go` - Configuration structure
- `/home/dkremer/keystone-gateway/cmd/main.go` - Main application and health endpoint
- `/home/dkremer/keystone-gateway/tests/integration/backend_health_integration_test.go` - Test patterns to follow

## Load Test Script Analysis

The `load-test.sh` script performs comprehensive HTTPS load testing using wrk:

1. **Health endpoint testing** (50 concurrent connections, 30 seconds)
2. **API subdomain testing** (100 concurrent connections, 30 seconds) 
3. **Load balancing testing** (150 concurrent connections, 30 seconds)
4. **Sustained load testing** (200 concurrent connections, 2 minutes)

The script targets HTTPS endpoints which will help identify the health check bug under real load conditions.
