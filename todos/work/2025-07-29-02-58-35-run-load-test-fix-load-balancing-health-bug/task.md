# Run Load Test and Fix Load Balancing Health Bug
**Status:** InProgress
**Agent PID:** 70989

## Original Todo
run load-test.sh and fix the  load balancing and health bug

## Description
I will run the load test script to identify performance issues and implement the missing active health check monitoring system for the keystone-gateway. The analysis reveals that while load balancing logic exists, backends never get marked as healthy because there's no background process performing health checks against the configured health endpoints.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Run Load Test to Identify Current Issues**
   - [x] Execute load-test.sh to baseline current performance and identify health check failures
   - [x] Analyze test results and error patterns

2. **Implement Active Health Check Monitoring System**
   - [x] Create health check manager in internal/routing/gateway.go (lines ~310-400)
   - [x] Add StartHealthChecks() method to initialize background goroutines
   - [x] Implement performHealthCheck() function for individual backend checks
   - [x] Add graceful shutdown for health check goroutines

3. **Integrate Health Checks with Gateway Initialization**
   - [x] Modify initializeRouters() in internal/routing/gateway.go (line ~84) to start health checks
   - [x] Update main.go to properly shutdown health checkers on exit
   - [x] Ensure health_interval configuration is properly used

4. **Update Backend Status Management**
   - [x] Modify backend initialization to start as healthy if health endpoint responds
   - [x] Add logging for health check state changes
   - [x] Ensure thread-safe updates to Alive status

5. **Testing and Validation**
   - [ ] Run load-test.sh again to verify health checks work under load
   - [ ] Add unit tests for health check functionality
   - [ ] Verify admin API shows accurate backend health status
   - [ ] Test failover scenarios with backend downtime
