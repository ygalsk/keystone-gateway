# Review Test Suite and Add E2E Tests and Performance Benchmarks
**Status:** InProgress
**Agent PID:** 772743

## Original Todo
review the curent test suite, add integration e2e tests and performance benchmarks, be KISS DRY and follow go principals, use fixtures

## Description
Based on comprehensive analysis of the keystone-gateway test suite, I need to enhance the testing infrastructure to ensure production readiness. The current test suite has excellent unit test coverage (78.9%) with outstanding fixture architecture following KISS/DRY principles, but lacks proper integration and E2E testing infrastructure.

The project has:
- **Excellent unit tests**: 10 comprehensive test files with table-driven patterns
- **Minimal integration tests**: Only 1 placeholder test 
- **No E2E tests**: Referenced in Makefile but directory doesn't exist
- **No performance tests**: No benchmarks or load testing infrastructure

I will build a comprehensive testing infrastructure that includes proper integration tests, full E2E testing framework, and performance benchmarks while maintaining the existing excellent fixture patterns and Go best practices.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create Integration Test Infrastructure** (tests/integration/)
   - [x] Expand tests/integration/basic_test.go with real component interaction tests
   - [x] Create component_integration_test.go for config-to-gateway and Lua-to-routing integration
   - [x] Add multitenant_integration_test.go for complete multi-tenant request handling scenarios
   - [x] Create backend_health_integration_test.go for health check → failover → recovery testing

2. **Build E2E Testing Framework** (tests/e2e/)
   - [x] Create tests/e2e/ directory structure with proper organization
   - [x] Implement gateway_e2e_test.go for full request lifecycle testing
   - [x] Add multitenant_e2e_test.go for real-world multi-tenant scenarios
   - [x] Create lua_integration_e2e_test.go for Lua script execution in request context
   - [x] Build E2E test fixtures and utilities following existing fixture patterns

3. **Implement Performance and Benchmark Testing**
   - [x] Create benchmark_test.go with BenchmarkGatewayRouting, BenchmarkLuaScriptExecution, BenchmarkLoadBalancing
   - [x] Add load testing infrastructure with TestConcurrentRequests and TestMemoryUsage
   - [x] Implement performance regression testing framework
   - [x] Create performance test fixtures for consistent benchmarking

4. **Enhance Test Infrastructure and Documentation**
   - [ ] Update Makefile targets for integration, e2e, and benchmark tests
   - [ ] Create test documentation explaining test organization and patterns
   - [ ] Add CI/CD integration for new test suites
   - [ ] Ensure all tests follow KISS/DRY principles and use existing fixture patterns

5. **Validation and Integration**
   - [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
   - [ ] Verify test coverage maintenance or improvement
   - [ ] Validate performance baselines are established
   - [ ] Test CI/CD pipeline with new test infrastructure
