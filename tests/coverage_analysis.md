## Impact Assessment

### Security Impact Matrix

| Priority | Function Count | Risk Level | Potential Impact |
|----------|----------------|------------|------------------|
| Critical | 11 | Very High | System compromise, data breach |
| High | 7 | High | Service disruption, DoS |
| Medium | 3 | Medium | Information disclosure |

### Business Continuity Risks

1. **Service Availability**: 65% of uncovered functions affect core service delivery
2. **Security Posture**: 52% of gaps are in security-critical paths
3. **Maintenance Burden**: Uncovered code increases debugging difficulty
4. **Compliance Risk**: Security gaps may violate compliance requirements

## Success Metrics

### Target Coverage Goals
- **Overall Coverage**: Increase from 77.9% to >85%
- **Critical Functions**: Achieve 100% coverage for all critical priority functions
- **Security Functions**: Achieve >95% coverage for all security-sensitive code
- **API Layer**: Achieve 100% coverage for Lua Route Registry API

### Quality Metrics
- Zero uncovered functions in critical priority
- <5% uncovered functions in high priority
- All security boundaries tested
- All error paths validated

## Conclusion

While the keystone-gateway project maintains good overall test coverage at 77.9%, **critical security and API functionality gaps** present significant risks. The **17 functions with 0% coverage** and **3 functions with low coverage** require immediate attention, particularly in the Lua Route Registry API and HTTP response handling.

**Immediate focus should be placed on the 11 critical priority functions** that pose the highest security and operational risks. Addressing these gaps will significantly improve system reliability, security posture, and maintainability.

The recommended testing strategy emphasizes security-first testing, comprehensive error handling, and real-world integration scenarios to ensure robust production deployment.
