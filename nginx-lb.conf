# Nginx Load Balancer Configuration for Keystone Gateway
#
# This distributes requests across multiple gateway instances using:
# - Least connections algorithm (sends to instance with fewest active connections)
# - Keepalive connections (reduces connection overhead)
# - Health checks (removes unhealthy instances from pool)
